Twitle
======

Greasemonkey user script to prevent the browers window title changes on Twitter showing the number of new tweets.

If you are unsure how to install the script:

- You need Greasemonkey on Firefox
- Head over to https://userscripts.org/scripts/show/141673 and grab it there
- Install. It will activate itself once you load a page on Twitter
- To verify it is indeed active, watch the page title after reloading Twitter: it should say "Twitle [Greasemonkey] installed" for some seconds, then revert to the normal Twitter page title
- You should never see a Twitter page title like "(23) Twitter/Home" again

That's all, folks
